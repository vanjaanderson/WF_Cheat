A small application for counting letters in Wordfeud
====================================================

I have just started this project to help me count letters when playing Wordfeud. This will also help me learn some Javascript, and I will continue developing it. In this first version, it's quit simple :) Hope you like it!

Nota Bene! In this first version, the letters used are for the swedish game!

Instructions for use
--------------------
1.	Click a letter on the screen to "count down" occurencies of them. There is a clicking sound to confirm the action.
2.	When a letter runs out, it will change color on the screen, to help you visualize number of letters left.
3.	Reset the game with the "Nollst√§ll"-button. 

Working Demo

To-Do-List
----------
This is my To-Do-List, not sorted by importance: 

* Count total remaining letters
* Save letter values in Local Storage (for "saving" the game)
* Make a function for undo / redo
* Show your and opponents hidden letters
* Implement letters for English games
